# HashMap Presentation

Collaborative project by Emmanuel, Janja, Svilen

## Introduction

The codes submitted to Github demonstrate multiple functionalites of the HashMap collection.


A good amount of Hashmap methods were used in our code. Usually in combination with foreach loops.

### Some of these are


* put() - This method simply adds an item to the HashMap
* putIfAbsent() - This method allows you to map a value to a key provided the given key isn't already associated with a value.
* replace() - This method replaces the specified value for a specified key.
* remove() - This method removes specified values with the associated specified keys from the map.
* putAll() - This method is used to insert the specified map in the map.
* clear() - This method clears the given mappings to the map
* isEmpty() - This method checks if the HashMap is empty and return true if it is.
* size() - This method returns the size of the Hashmap.

Amongst various other methods.
